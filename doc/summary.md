# Asteriod Mining
Asteroid Mining is a round-based, mulitplayer game with a graphical user interface in Java. The game was developed by us during our Software Lab course in the 3rd semester.

## Goal of the Game
The goal of the game is to build a space station in the asteroid belt.  In order to achieve that players have to gather resources and cooperate. 
Each player controls up to 3 settlers which can travel between the asteroids in order to drill and mine them. Besides the settlers players can use autonomuous robots for support.
