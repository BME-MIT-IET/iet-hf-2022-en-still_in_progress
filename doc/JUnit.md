# JUnit Tests for Backend Classes

We implemented unit tests for the following classes

- Asteroid (10 tests)
- Game
- Settler
- Robot (4 tests)

## Description


## Main Results
The test `perihelionChanger_WaterIceAsteroidUT_NoSublimation()` actually revealed an error in the `perihelionChanger()` method. The error was immediately fixed.




## Lessons learnt

- implementing tests requires deep understanding of the control flow of the tested method
- initializing objects for internal checks
- using IDE supported tools for better and similar results
